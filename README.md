# Learning-to-Code
This repository is for me to document my journey learning to code. My goal is to become an expert developer and to have a career in programming and start my own business.

Day 1 - I am kicking off this journey by working through free code camp and learning to code using their course. I will work through the tutorials and complete the projects which i will upload into my github. I also have a few ideas on projects that i would like to complete. but first i would like to get through a good amount of freecodecamp.
